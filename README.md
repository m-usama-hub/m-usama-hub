# Hello, 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Senior Backend Developer**, **Blockchain Enthusiast**, and a **Cloud Solutions Architect** with a strong passion for building high-performance, scalable, and secure backend systems. My expertise spans across multiple technologies, including **Node.js**, **PHP**, **TypeScript**, and **cloud platforms** like **AWS** and **Google Cloud**.

## 🚀 About Me:
With years of experience in backend development and API integrations, I specialize in creating seamless infrastructures for web and mobile applications. My journey has taken me from working on large-scale systems to exploring **blockchain technologies** and **futuristic tech** like **Web 3.0**. My goal is to continuously push the boundaries of what's possible with modern software development.

If you're interested in **custom backend development**, **API integrations**, or **cloud solutions**, I’m your go-to developer. I take pride in delivering robust, well-architected systems that meet the unique needs of every project I work on.
